### Hi, I'm PerceptronV!

I'm interested in creating explainable systems with human-like intelligence.

- 🦾 I do projects related to machine learning, LLMs, NLP, networks/graphs, programming languages, and anything cool and hacky
- 🧠 I like learning AI, algorithms, number theory, and languages
- 🧩 I'm interested in anything computer science, physics, maths, philosophy, literature, or linguistics...
- ⛺ ... and I enjoy the great outdoors!
- 🤝 Feel free to reach out about anything!

> 💭 Stuff I'm thinking: [`Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus`](https://lab42.global/arc/), `Bayesian learning`, `neuro-symbolic AI` <br/>
> 📖 Books I'm reading: `Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid (Douglas Hofstadter)`, `中國通史 (呂思勉)`
