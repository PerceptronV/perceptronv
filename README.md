### Hi, I'm PerceptronV!

I'm interested in creating explainable systems with human-like intelligence.

- 🦾 I do projects related to machine learning (LLMs, CLIP, autoencoders, embeddings, etc.), networks/graphs, programming languages, and anything cool and hacky
- 🧠 I like learning AI, algorithms, number theory, and languages (and sometimes make them!)
- 🧩 I'm interested in computer science, physics, maths, psychology, philosophy, literature, art history...
- ⛺ ... and I enjoy the great outdoors!
- 🤝 Feel free to reach out about anything.

> 💭 Stuff I'm thinking: [`Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus`](https://lab42.global/arc/), `Bayesian learning`, `neuro-symbolic AI` <br/>
> 📖 Books I'm reading: `The Cognitive Basis of Aesthetics (Elena Fell, Ioanna Kopsiafti)`, `What Makes Us Smart (Samuel Gershman)`
